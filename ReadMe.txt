Option 1

I work the project individually.

On how to run this program:
1. You should download a package called Pillow (I imported PIL in my program for the images look).
*Turn on Terminal and if you use MAC, copy the following: "python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow".
*If you are using Window, copy the following: "pip install pillow" on your terminal.
*Wait until you see the word "Sucessfully Download" on your terminal for both systems.

***IGNORE THE ABOVE INFORMATION if you already have this package downloaded SUCCESSFULLY.

2. Unzip Texas_Holdem_GUI.zip
3. cd into Texas_Holdem_GUI/
4. python or python3 or whatever way python is running on your machine
Eg. python Project_Yanlin_Wu.py -u -p 3 (I set up a fixed number of bots so no matter what number of bots you put in it will always be 3).


Running the program may take time with GUI involves and please be patient.
If it doesn't react at fist, try to left click once.
If it doesn't react or react slowly during bet or fold, try to click the buttons one more time.
If the above doesn't work, try to restart the terminal and follow the instructions above again.
